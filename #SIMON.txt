Simon: The GOAT in Every Way

Boom. That’s the sound of greatness arriving — and it’s probably just Simon walking into the room. From the moment he says “hello,” you know you’re in for something special. Whether it’s cracking a joke that has the whole squad rolling, or showing up with the best ideas during lunch, Simon just has that energy.

But Simon isn’t just funny or smart — he’s the GOAT (Greatest of All Time) for a reason. He brings people together, makes life a little brighter, and always keeps it real. You could be having the most boring day, and then boom — Simon shows up and everything flips.

Simon is the kind of person who turns a regular moment into a memory. And if you’ve ever had lunch with him, you already know: legends aren’t born, they order extra fries and share them with everyone.

Simply put, Simon is the GOAT — no argument needed.
